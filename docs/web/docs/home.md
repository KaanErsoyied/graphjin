### Stop strugging with ORM's and complex SQL just to fetch the data you need. Instead try asking nicely with GraphQL.

80% of all web app development is reading or writing to a database. 100x your productivity and save valuable time by making that super simple.

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 5) {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
    picture_url
    posts(first: 20, order_by: { score: desc }) {
      slug
      title
      created_at
      votes_total
      votes {
        created_at
      }
      author {
        id
        name
      }
      tags {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    posts_cursor
  }
}
```

### Super Graph automatially compiles your GraphQL into an efficient SQL query giving you the results you wanted.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 5,
      "threads": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "This is a sample tite for this thread.",
          "topics": [
            {
              "id": 3,
              "name": "CloudRun"
            }
          ]
        }]
      },
      "posts": [
        {
          "id": 1477,
          "body": "These are some example contents for this post.",
          "slug": "monitor-negotiate-store-1476",
          "votes": [],
          "author": {
            "id": 5,
            "email": "jordanecruickshank@ferry.io"
          },
          "created_at": "2020-05-13T13:51:21.729501+00:00"
        },
        ...
  }
}
```

## How do I use it?

Super Graph can be used in two ways. You can run it as a standalone service serving as an API backend for your app or as a library within your own app code. Super Graph is built in GO a secure and high-performance language from Google used to build cloud infratructure.

### Using it as a service

```bash
go get github.com/dosco/super-graph
super-graph new <app_name>
```

### Using it in your own code

```bash
go get github.com/dosco/super-graph/core
```

```go
package main

import (
  "database/sql"
  "fmt"
  "time"
  "github.com/dosco/super-graph/core"
  _ "github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/stdlib"
)

func main() {
  db, err := sql.Open("pgx", "postgres://postgrs:@localhost:5432/example_db")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  sg, err := core.NewSuperGraph(nil, db)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  query := `
    query {
      posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }`

  res, err := sg.GraphQL(context.Background(), query, nil)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(res.Data))
}
```

## Why I created Super Graph

After working on several products through my career I found that we spend way too much time on building API backends. Most APIs also need constant updating, and this costs time and money.

It's always the same thing, figure out what the UI needs then build an endpoint for it. Most API code involves struggling with an ORM to query a database and mangle the data into a shape that the UI expects to see.

I didn't want to write this code anymore, I wanted the computer to do it. Enter GraphQL, to me it sounded great, but it still required me to write all the same database query code.

Having worked with compilers before I saw this as a compiler problem. Why not build a compiler that converts GraphQL to highly efficient SQL.

This compiler is what sits at the heart of Super Graph, with layers of useful functionality around it like authentication, remote joins, rails integration, database migrations, and everything else needed for you to build production-ready apps with it.
